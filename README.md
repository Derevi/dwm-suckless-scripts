# dwm-suckless-scripts
The repo contains a few scripts that I use to automate some things in dwm or some other suckless program
feel free to use it may save you some time

my scripts will mostly be written in bash so there are zero dependencies

its probably easier just to copy paste the code then even git clone it due to its simplicity
