#!/bin/bash

# WHAT THIS DOES: this script will generate a custom dmenu that will display user defined options and upon selection will run some command.
# it is great for categorizing commonly used commands. Example, I use this for poweroff,reboot,lock,suspend.
# this is an example of generating a custom dmenu command that will show power options:
#./this-script "power" "choose power option" "poweroff" "systemctl poweroff" "reboot" "systemctl reboot" "lock" "light-locker-command -l" "suspend" "systemctl suspend"
# in addition to creating generating a script it will also create a symlink of the script so that it is easier to call

# USAGE NOTES
# !! you should probably change the value of the variable OUTPUT to a path of your choosing.. also probably might be helpful to change the path of the ln -s command near the end.
# ON THE FIRST PARAMETER $1:
# first parameter $1 is always the name of the file which dmenu will display, this script will generate an symlink with 
# the filename prefixed by "dmenu-" ex. if we use file name "some-command" the symlink will be named "dmenu-some-command"
# the symlink is placed in /usr/local/bin
# ON THE SECOND PARAMETER $2:
# the second parameter is the string in which dmenu will prompt when asking for the selection
# ALL OTHERS:
# parameters (greater than 2) are ALWAYS entered as a pair where the first parameter is the label to be selected in dmenu
# the next consecutive parameter is ALWAYS the command that will be run for that respective label
# example $1="file-manager", $2="file-manager-command", $3="some option in dmenu", $4="command-for-option"
# this implies (for parameters greater than 2) all odd numbered parameters are the dmenu selection label and all even numbered parameters are the respective commands

# PS. I realize this is messy, and not optimal, im not a pro in bash and just wanted write something quick and simple. I probably wont refactor because I'd rather
# be doing something else. If you want to refactor and  make it more elegant as opposed to the functional slop, go for it, let me know I can update this too.
# I apologize in advance for the inconsistent use of printf and echo. it just works this way so meh.
